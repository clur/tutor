Installation instructions for sublime text 2, python3 and ipython3 on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
=================================================================================================

This document describes the installation procedure for all the software needed for the Python class. If your stuck anywhere in the installation procedure, please do not hesitate to contact Folgert Karsdorp (folgert.karsdorp@meertens.knaw.nl).

=============
# All systems
=============

We advice you to install a good text editor, Sublime text 2. However, you are absolutely free to use your own favourite editor. For Sublime Text 2 go to http://www.sublimetext.com/ download the version for your operating system and install.

In the course we will be using software that works best with Google Chrome.  Firefox 6 (or above) and Safari will also work. Internet Explorer is not supported. 

We will be using Python 3 for our course, so lower versions of Python are not sufficient. 

=============
# Windows
=============

1. Download and install pyzo from http://www.pyzo.org/downloads.html (use pyzo_distro-2013b.win32.exe)
2. After (default) installation python3 resides in the folder c:\pyzo2013b 
3. Check your installation by double clicking the ipython executable.
4. For the course you will need to use iPython's notebook. To launch the notebook you will have to open `Command Prompt' (`Opdrachtprompt' in Dutch) via `Start' -> `run' and then type `cmd'. Now first go to the right folder by typing:

    cd c:\pyzo2013b

After that launch the notebook with:

    ipython_notebook.exe

Or, alternatively:
    
    ipython.exe notebook

If everything goes right, this should open your browser (preferably Google Chrome or Firefox) on a page http://127.0.0.1:8888/ (or something similar) which says `IP[y]: Notebook'. If for some reason, the notebook is opened by IE, copy the URL and paste that in either Google Chrome or Firefox.

=============
# OS X 
=============
1. First you will need to install Xcode from the App Store. After you have successfully installed Xcode, open Xcode and go to Xcode -> preferences -> Downloads. Now click on the install button next to commandline tools. 
2. Open spotlight and type in `terminal' to open the terminal application. (You can also go to your applications folder and then to utilities where you'll find the terminal.app)

3. Cd to the folder where you downloaded or saved the file mac-installer.sh (probably in ~/Downloads) by using

   cd /folder/of/mac-installer.sh 

4. Run the installer with the following command. The installer will download some packages and will request for your password to install them.

   . mac-installer.sh

5. To check your installation, relaunch the terminal.app. Then type in 

    ipython3 notebook 

   If everything went well this should open your browser (best with Google Chrome or Firefox) on the page http://127.0.0.1:8888/ which says IP[y]: Notebook.

========================
# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
========================

1. Open a terminal
2. Type: sudo apt-get install python3 ipython3 ipython3-notebook  

If you run another Linux distribution, similar packages should be available.
